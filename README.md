# MultiSig-wallet

This is my first "Hello-world" Solidity pracitce project. It is a multi-signature wallet as part of the *Ivan on Tech academy* smart contract programming courses. It represents a smart contract with more than one owners and a certain number of signatures required, to withdraw funds from the contract. 

The purpose to this was to practice the basics, like:
- basic Solidity elements - variable types, structs, modifiers, events, mappings
- creating functions
- contract hierarchy and importing them from separate files
